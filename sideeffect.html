            <p>how to dose desflurane for children?
Suprane (desflurane, USP) is not recommended for induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients because of the high to moderate upper-airway incidence. After induction of anesthesia with agents other than suprane, and tracheal intubation, suprane is indicated as anesthesia maintenance in infants and children.
In which dosage is desflurane available?
Suprane (desflurane, USP), NDC 10019-641-24, packaged in amber colored bottles containing 240 mL desflurane.

        <h3>A common occurrence</h3>

<h4>Warning</h4>
What to know before using desflurane?
When deciding to use certain medications, consider the risks and benefits first. This is a decision you and your doctor must make. For desflurane, note the following:

Allergy

Let your doctor know if you have an unusual or allergic reaction to this drug or other medication. Tell your doctor as well if you have other types of allergies such as food, dyes, preservatives, or animal allergies. For non-prescription products, read the label on the packaging carefully.
Children
Desflurane has been tested in children. Not used to initiate anesthesia in children who are awake for causing irritation and other undesirable effects. However, when used to continue general anesthesia that has started with other anesthesia, desflurane does not cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.
Elderly
Desflurane has been tested and has not been proven to cause different side effects or problems in the elderly from young adults. However, the elderly usually require a small amount of dope from a younger person. The doctor will take into account your age when deciding the right amount of desflurane for you.
<h5>Interaction</h5>
<h6>What drugs might interact with desflurane?</h6>
Although some drugs may not be consumed simultaneously, in other cases some drugs may also be used simultaneously even if interactions may occur. In such cases, the doctor may change the dosage, or do any other necessary precautions. When you use this medicine, it is very important for your doctor to know if you are taking any of the medications from the following list. The following interactions are selected on the basis of their potential significance and not all of them are inclusive.
Using this medication with some of the medicines below is usually not recommended, but in some cases it may be necessary. If both drugs are prescribed for you, your doctor will usually change the dosage or determine how often you should take the medication.
-Cisatracurium
-Hydromorphone
-Nitrous Oxide
-St. John's Wort
Can food or alcohol interact with desflurane?
Certain medications should not be used at meals or at certain foods because drug interactions can occur. Consuming alcohol or tobacco with certain drugs may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss your drug use with food, alcohol, or tobacco with your health care provider.
What health conditions can interact with desflurane?
Any other health problems in your body can affect the use of this drug. Tell your doctor if you have other health problems especially:
diseases that can cause muscle weakness, such as periodic familial palsy, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, or Eaton-Lambert syndrome
heart disease or blood vessels-the possibility of side effects may increase, but serious problems can be prevented if the doctor knows of this condition before giving you an anesthetic
malignant hyperthermia, during or shortly after receiving an anesthetic. Signs of malignant hyperthermia include very high fever, rapid and irregular heartbeat, muscle spasms or tightness, and respiratory problems-side effects can occur again
Overdose
What should I do in an emergency or overdose?
